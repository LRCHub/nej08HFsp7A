# SILICA GEL – BIG VOID

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
When the dogs become the wolves
and bite into the carrion
In a world where I can't be me
as my tears fall in legion
Ode to sky
A winged melody
Still waiting on the words I once banished
to carry it into the next life
Everyone into the void (uh)
Clock that runs back-ward
You know what? She’s innocent (uh)
It’s a choice for us
Everyone into the void (uh)
After winter melts and drips into light….
No sky
When the sparks become a fire
and the natives rise as one
In a world where I can't be me
brain breathes in light
Ye Ye Ye
You know what? I’m innocent (uh)
Everyone into the void (uh)
After winter melts and drips into light…
No sky
```
