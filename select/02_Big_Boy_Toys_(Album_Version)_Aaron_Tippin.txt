I hook my wagon to my trac
And I head across the yard
To my big sandbox
Where I work real hard
Playin' all day
With my little toy trucks
Backhoes Bulldozers herdin' in some stuff
That was my whole life
When I was a kid
But when I grew up
I guess I never really did
I like 'em Big Boy Toys
Motors and lights
Knobs and switches
And a four-wheel drive
Runnin' up the road
Or crawlin' cross the farm
And when they break down
I jack 'em up in the yard
Pull out my tools
My pride and joy
Man you gotta love 'em
Big Boy Toys
Now sometimes baby
You just can't understand
The mud on my boots
And the grease on my hands
I've tried to explain
How it makes me feel
The awesome power
Of my hands on the wheel
If I can't find the words
To set things right
I just scoot over
And I let my baby drive
She likes Big Boy Toys
Motors and lights
Knobs and switches
And a four-wheel drive
Runnin'up the road
Or crawlin' cross the farm
And when they break down
I jack 'em up in the yard
Pull out my tools
My pride and joy
Man you gotta love 'em
Big Boy Toys
Yeah
It's boats and cars
Tractors and trucks
Gasoline and diesel fuel
Are runnin' through my blood
I like 'em Big Bpy Toys
Motors and lights
Knobs and switches
And a four-wheel drive
Runnin' up the road
Or crawlin' cross the farm
And when they break down
I jack 'em up in the yard
Pull out my tools
My pride and joy
Man you gotta love 'em
Big Boy Toys
Man you gotta love 'em
Big Boy Toys
